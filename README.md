# BC-Note
While I was interned in Georgia, I worked on the project BC-Note---an android app where students can save their daily class 
shedule and plans.
The app had the flash page with the BC campus picture on it, animated transitions between activities, seven colorful 
buttons(Monday through Sunday) and time picker feature which allows students to set the of the class 


 The app includes the ability for the user to view it in different languages. Still working on the reminder feature that
 notifies students several minutes earlier before their class starts.
